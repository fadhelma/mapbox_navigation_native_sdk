# Example Usage

This directory would contain an example Flutter app showing how to use the Mapbox Navigation SDK package.

Since this is now a package, the example should be a separate Flutter project that depends on this package.

To create an example:

1. Create a new Flutter project:
```bash
flutter create example
cd example
```

2. Add the package to pubspec.yaml:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mapbox_navigation_sdk:
    path: ../
```

3. Follow the usage instructions in the main README.md file.
